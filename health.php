       <h1>Peppermint</h1>
      <p>Mint has been used for hundreds of years as a health remedy. Peppermint oil might help with irritable bowel syndrome -- a long-term condition that can cause cramps, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation -- and it may be good for headaches as well. More studies are needed to see how much it helps and why. People use the leaf for other conditions, too, but there’s very little evidence it helps with any of them. </p>

    <h1>Turmeric</h1>
    <p>This spice has been hyped as being able to help with a variety of conditions from arthritis to fatty liver. There is some early research to support this. Other claims, such as healing ulcers and helping with skin rashes after radiation are lacking proof. If you try it, don’t overdo it: High doses can cause digestive problems.It's a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. It may also help improve symptoms of depression and arthritis.</p>

    <h1>Ginger</h1>
    <p>It’s been used for thousands of years in Asian medicine to treat stomachaches, diarrhea, and nausea, and studies show that it works for nausea and vomiting. There’s some evidence that it might help with menstrual cramps, too. Ginger also appears to have beneficial effects on the enzymes trypsin and pancreatic lipase, which are important for digestion.Many people use ginger to help recover from a cold or the flu.</p>

    <h1>Honey</h1>
    <p>This natural sweetener may work just as well for a cough as over-the-counter medicines. That could be especially helpful for children who aren’t old enough to take those. But don’t give it to an infant or a toddler younger than 1. There’s a small risk of a rare but serious kind of food poisoning that could be dangerous for them. And while you may have heard that “local” honey can help with allergies, studies don’t back that up.</p>
