### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khushi and I've been working on frontend and backend languages. I'm familiar with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and C/C++. Currently, I'm learning Java and Python and I'm looking for an internship or research opportunity that will allow me to utilize my problem solving skills to further develop my abilities in the field of computer science.
