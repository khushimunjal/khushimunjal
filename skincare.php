    <h1>Dry skin</h1>
    <p class="py-2">These face masks are easy to make, and the ingredients are already lying in your kitchen. So, you shouldn’t be left with an excuse for not adding one or more of these face masks to a daily skin care routine for dry skin.</p>

    <h4>Apply Coconut Oil Before Bedtime</h4>
    <p>Coconut oil becomes a solid at room temperature, so use it as a moisturizing cream at bedtime or anytime,” recommends Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at SkinSafe Dermatology and Skin Care in Beverly Hills, California. “For chapped heels and hands, apply the oil, then layer with thick socks or nonlatex gloves.”</p>

    <h4>Make a Natural Olive Oil and Sugar Scrub </h4>
    <p>Create a naturally moisturizing exfoliating scrub using a combination of olive oil and sugar. Combine ½ cup of sugar with 2 tbsp of olive oil. If you want, you can also add an essential oil like lavender, which adds a natural fragrance and can promote relaxation. Gently rub the scrub into your skin, and then wash it off. Last, use a soothing moisturizer to lock in the benefits of freshly exfoliated skin.</p>

    <h4>Create an Easy Oatmeal Soak to Calm Your Skin </h4>
    <p>Adding a cup of oatmeal to a warm bath can naturally rehydrate dry skin, Poblete-Lopez says. "The oat product itself is soothing," she explains, and it helps your skin retain moisture from the bathwater. It is very soothing for dry skin as it provides moisture. It soothes the itchy skin.</p>

    <h4>Apply Aloe Vera to Dry, Irritated Skin</h4>
    <p>While often thought of as a remedy for sunburn relief, aloe vera gel can be helpful during the dry winter months, too. It works by alleviating redness and irritation related to excess dryness, and it can even decrease signs of aging, as well as acne breakouts, according to previous research. You may want to perform a patch test first before applying it to a large area of skin.
    Aloevera is useful in everything as it improves your skin texture, hair quality as well as digestive system.</p>

    <h4>Milk Compresses</h4>
    <p>Milk has natural anti-inflammatory properties. "It also contains lactic acid, a mild, natural exfoliant.” To make a milk compress, soak a clean cloth (like a washcloth or a towel) in a bowl of cool milk, and holding it in place over any dry areas. Use this compresses on your skin for 5 to 10 minutes at a time. It’s especially helpful for irritated skin that’s itchy, too. Lactic acid can sting cracked skin, though, so use with caution.</p>
