<h5>There is no better time than now to start living healthy. When health is absent, wisdom cannot reveal itself, art cannot manifest, strength cannot fight, wealth becomes useless ,and intelligence cannot be applied.So the best investment you can ever make is in your own health.</h5>
<h5>Everyone needs a little motivation and inspiration once in a while. Beauty is interpreted in many ways, that is the amazing thing about diversity. It is a common belief anyone can be beautiful when they have a smile on their face and radiate positivity and love.
</h5>
<h5> Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.</h5></p>
